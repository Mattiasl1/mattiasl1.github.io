				<p>This prototype app was created during my internship at Levento Creative Consultans with my classmate
					Staffan Ljungqvist.
					we were asked to create an mvp app for Småföretagarnas Riksförbund which is a national federation
					for entrepreneurs.
					We started of by charting the features, designing the UI, presenting interactive wireframes, we
					wanted to make the app available for both iOS and Android and I was tasked with developing the iOS
					app which I decided to make in SwiftUI. <br />
					The app's three main functions is ability to use a digital membership, a channel for relevant news
					and a databank for the special deals and offers. <br />
					All the content is made to be dynamic with continuous updates. News article posts are parsed from an
					RSS feed stemming from the already established webpage. <br />
					The database of offers from numerous companies are hosted on firebase, and are available to browse
					on the app sorted by category as well as featured content.</p>
